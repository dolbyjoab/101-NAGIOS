## <a name="Introduction">Introduction</a>

<p align="justify"> Nagios is a server monitoring infrastructure. In the olds days we used to have to run horribly cryptics commands like <b>sar, ps, du, df, and others,</b> then parse the output with awk and sed and then figure out how to do something with the data. These commands were never standardized so scripts running under Solaris may not work as expected under SunOS! Things gradually evolved and Nagios came on the scene almost 20 years ago. Nagios is now used to monitor sites with hundreds of thousands of services and you can configure tiered monitoring if you need maximum scalability. Nagios is incredibly flexible, but its greatest strength is also its weakness. Its power comes from the fact that it is based on scripting, allowing you to monitor literally anything. It's notification system is also based on scripts, so you can do whatever you like with the information, even restart services, clean old logs, or whatever. You can even download pre-written scripts to extend Nagios in all sorts of ways. Check the Nagios website for a repository.

<details>
<summary><b>Explain Nagios or what is Nagios, explain it.</b></summary><br>

*Nagios is a monitoring tool that is used for continuous monitoring of system services, applications, and business processes. Even in case of any failure, Nagios tool can alert the technical staff about the problem. As a result, DevOps professionals or technical team members can begin the required remediation processes before the negative impact of any business processes, customers, and end-users. Here, in such cases, the team does not have to explain anyone that why an unseen infrastructure outage affects the bottom line of the organization.*

Now as you know ‘what is Nagios?’ then you can also mention the things that can be achieved by the Nagios DevOps tool:

* Automatic problem fixing as and when they occur.
* Infrastructure upgrades planning even before any failure due to an outdated system.
* Technical team response coordination.
* To ensure that SLA of your organization will be met.
* To monitor the business process and the entire infrastructure.
* To respond to issues even as and when they arise.
